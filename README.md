Static Comp Challenge 3 - Project Overview
==========================================

In the course of my studies at Turing, I was tasked with recreating the following composition, and making my own version responsive on multiple platforms.

### The Original Composition:

For this challenge, I set out to make each section responsive and clean before heading to the next. I did meet this goal for the navigation sections to the left and top-right of the page, but ultimately did not meet it for the page content section.

### My Version on Desktop:
